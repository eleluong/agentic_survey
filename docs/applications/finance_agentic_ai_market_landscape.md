# **Agentic AI in Finance: Market Landscape and Applications**  
**Agentic AI** refers to autonomous systems that independently set and pursue goals with minimal human input. In finance, these systems transcend basic automation by **perceiving data, reasoning, acting, and learning iteratively** to manage complex, multi-step tasks. Citi analysts describe this shift as enabling a *“Do It For Me” economy*, where AI agents execute transactions and optimize financial decisions. Financial institutions—already the second-largest adopters of generative AI—are deploying agentic systems across diverse functions. Key application categories include:  

1. **Personal Finance Management (PFM)**  
2. **Algorithmic Trading & Portfolio Management**  
3. **Wealth Management & Robo-Advisory**  
4. **Risk Analysis & Credit Underwriting**  
5. **Fraud Detection & AML**  
6. **Regulatory Compliance & Reporting**  
7. **Finance Operations Automation**  

Below, we analyze each category, highlighting market leaders, emerging players, and adoption trends.
